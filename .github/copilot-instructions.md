This project is a Requirements Analysis & User Story Generator tool with a Java Spring Boot backend and Angular frontend. The backend exposes REST APIs for analyzing requirements, generating user stories, and producing LLD artifacts. The frontend allows users to input requirements, view/edit generated user stories and LLD, and export results.

- For backend code, follow Spring Boot best practices (controllers, services, DTOs).
- For frontend code, use Angular best practices (services for API calls, components for UI, modules for structure).
- Ensure CORS is enabled on the backend for local development.
- Use mock data for AI/NLP until integration is specified.
